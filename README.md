The 4th project of the Foundations course in The Odin Project, and a really fun one too.

Allow users to make freestyle lines on a grid by colouring pixels which are hovered on

Technologies used:
HTML to provide website boilerplate
CSS to add some design and arranging elements
JS to add the drawing behaviour and dynamic grid generation.
